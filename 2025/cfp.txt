=====================================================================

The 20th International Symposium on Logical and Semantic Frameworks,
with Applications (LSFA 2025) is a satellite event of the 18th
Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM 2025) to be held
in Brasília, the capital of Brazil, from October 6 to October 11,
2025.

LSFA is an International Symposium on Logical and Semantic Frameworks
with Applications (see https://lsfa-workshop.github.io/) launched in
2006. Logical and semantic frameworks are formal languages that
represent logics and languages, as well as computational, AI and
deductive systems. These frameworks provide mathematical foundations
for the formal specification of systems and programming languages,
supporting tool development and reasoning.

The LSFA series is a platform that fosters collaboration, bringing
together theoreticians and practitioners. LSFA aims to promote
techniques and results from the theoretical side, ranging from
well-established ones such as lambda calculus and type theory to
state-of-the-art ones such as machine learning, and provide feedback
on integrating, implementing and using such methods and results from
the practical side.


Topics
------

A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest includes:

* Automated deduction
* Applications of logical and/or semantic frameworks
* Computational and logical properties of semantic frameworks
* Formal semantics of languages and systems
* Implementation of logical and/or semantic frameworks
* Lambda and combinatory calculi
* Logical aspects of computational complexity
* Logical frameworks
* Process calculi
* Proof theory
* Semantic frameworks
* Specification languages and meta-languages
* Type theory


Submission
----------

Contributions should be written in English and submitted in the form
of full papers (with a maximum of 16 pages excluding references) or
short papers (with a maximum of 6 pages excluding references). They
must be unpublished and not submitted simultaneously for publication
elsewhere. The papers should be prepared in latex using EPTCS
style. The submission should be in the form of a PDF file uploaded to
EasyChair:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lsfa2025

Submissions will be evaluated by the Program Committee regarding their
significance for the symposium.  The accepted papers will appear in
the LSFA 2025 proceedings, published online as EPTCS proceedings.
At least one of the authors should register for the
conference. Presentations should be in English.

According to the quality of submissions, the chairs will promote
further publication of journal revised versions of the
papers. Previous LSFA Special Issues have been published in journals
as The Logical J. of the IGPL, Theoretical Computer Science and
Mathematical Structures in Computer Science.
