Brasília is served by an international airport which handles around 19 million passengers a year. As part of the preparation for hosting the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the airport received massive investments, from both the public and private sectors, for the renovation of the passenger’s terminals and the enlargement of the taxiways, which has allowed to almost double the number of positions available for aircrafts and, thus, increase the number of available routes for both domestic and international flights. International flights directly connect Brasília with Santiago (Chile), Panama City (Panama), Miami (USA), Atlanta (USA), and Lisbon (Portugal).
</p>

<p>
It is also worthy mentioning that Brasília hosts one of the most important regional hubs in Brazil. There are direct flights from all the state capitals, including Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Porto Alegre, Natal, Recife, among other places which are easily accessible directly from other continents and from other countries in the Americas.
</p>

<p>
Brasília is centrally located and well served by coaches from elsewhere in Brazil, but prices for internal flights are competitive and travel times much shorter.

There is also an Executive Bus from the airport to the Hotels Sectors. It runs every half an hour and stops by the door of or conveniently close to the main hotels in these areas. The trip costs R$ 12.00 (around € 2.50).
</p>

<p>
Regular buses (lines 102, 102.1) also run from the airport to the main bus terminal in town, are frequent and quite cheap (€ 0.50). From the bus terminal you will need to catch another bus or a taxi to get to other places. If you do not speak Portuguese or do not know your way around, this is not recommended for you.

Brasília is a modern, lively place, with a variety of attractions worth seeing. For those who like the urban environment and cultural activities, almost all public buildings are open for visitation, most of them with free guided tours. Besides the architectural features, they hold interesting art collections which are also open for visitation. For the more adventurous, we are in the middle of the Cerrado ecosystem, which makes trips to nearby parks and waterfalls a very pleasant experience. Some of the suggested places to visit include the National parks:
