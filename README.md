# About LSFA
LSFA is an International Workshop on Logical and Semantic Frameworks with Applications. Logical and semantic frameworks are formal languages used to represent logics, languages, and systems. These frameworks provide mathematical foundations for the formal specification of systems and programming languages, supporting tool development and reasoning.

This series aims to put together theoreticians and practitioners to promote new techniques and results from the theoretical side and to provide feedback on the implementation and use of such techniques and results from the practical side. 

LSFA started in 2006 in Natal (LSFA06), and its second and third editions were held in Ouro Preto ([LSFA07](https://mat.unb.br/~ayala/lsfa2007/welcome.html)) and Salvador (LSFA08) always as a satellite event to the Brazilian Symposium on Formal Methods (SBMF). In 2009 ([LSFA09](http://lsfa09.cic.unb.br/index.html)) it was held as a satellite event of [RDP](http://rdp09.cic.unb.br/) in Brasília, and subsequently, LSFA was a satellite event of ICTAC in Natal ([LSFA10](http://www.tecmf.inf.puc-rio.br/LSFA)). Since its sixth edition, LSFA was held alone in Belo Horizonte (LSFA11), Rio de Janeiro and Niteroi (LSFA12), São Paulo (LSFA13), Brasília ([LSFA14](http://lsfa2014.cic.unb.br/)) and then in Natal ([LSFA15](https://www.mat.ufrn.br/~LSFA2015/LSFA2015/Welcome.html)) as part of NAT@Logic 2015. The eleventh edition, ([LSFA16](http://lsfa2016.mat.unb.br/)), was held as a satellite event of [FSCD 2016](http://fscd2016.dcc.fc.up.pt/) in Porto, the twelfth edition, ([LSFA17](http://lsfa2017.cic.unb.br/)), in Brasília, as a satellite of the collocated conferences [Tableaux](http://www.tableaux-ar.org/)+[FroCoS](http://frocos.cs.uiowa.edu/)+[ITP](https://itp2016.inria.fr/history/), the thirteenth edition, ([LSFA18](http://lia.ufc.br/~lsfa2018/)), was held alone in Fortaleza, the fourteenth edition, ([LSFA19](https://sites.google.com/view/lsfa2019)), as a satellite of [CADE 2019](https://www.mat.ufrn.br/cade-27/) in Natal, and the fifteenth edition, ([LSFA20](http://lsfa2020.ufba.br/)), took place in Bahia with the First Brazilian Workshop on Logic [WBL](http://lsfa2020.ufba.br/wbl.html). The Sixteen edition, ([LSFA2021](https://mat.unb.br/lsfa2021/)), was held as a satellite of [FSCD2021](https://fscd2021.dc.uba.ar), organised in Buenos Aires, online. The Seventeen edition ([LSFA2022](https://lsfa2022.github.io)) took place in Belo Horizonte. In 2023, the Eighteenth edition ([LSFA2023](https://sites.google.com/ufg.br/lsfa2023)) was affiliated to ([FSCD2023](https://easyconferences.eu/fscd2023/)) in Rome.    

 ** [Daniel Lima Ventura](https://ww2.inf.ufg.br/~daniel/) and [Thaynara Arielly de Lima](https://thaynaradelima.github.io/) are organizing The Nineteenth Logical and Semantic Frameworks with Applications, [LSFA 2024](https://sites.google.com/ufg.br/lsfa2024), in Goiânia from 18 to 20 September.

3.  The Steering Committee selects its chair(s).  
4.  Each Steering Committee member serves until the third subsequent conference. At most, one-third of the SC members can be renewed at each conference. To keep this balance, exceptionally, and with the approval of the General Assembly, it is possible to extend the term of some of the members of the SC for one year.  
5.  The General Assembly of each conference votes by secret ballot for new Steering Committee members to replace the outgoing members. The maximum number of candidate indications allowed for each attendee of the General Assembly equals the number of open positions in that election. The total indications per candidate are computed, and the most voted, up to the number of open positions, will be considered elected.  

## Function:

1.  Provide support to the Program Committee and Meeting Committee.
2.  Propose the Program Committee chair, site, and tentative date for the meeting in the next two years.
3.  Advertising and other issues concerning the publicity of the conference.
4.  Act as liaison with other conferences and workshops.
5.  Call and organize the General Assembly.
6.  Organize the election of new Steering Committee members.
7.  Explore technical/organizational supports for non-local resources.
8.  Maintain an official mailing list and records of the previous meetings.
