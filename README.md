# About LSFA
LSFA is an International Workshop on Logical and Semantic Frameworks with Applications. Logical and semantic frameworks are formal languages used to represent logics, languages and systems. These frameworks provide mathematical foundations for formal specification of systems and programming languages, supporting tool development and reasoning.

The objective of this series is to put together theoreticians and practitioners to promote new techniques and results, from the theoretical side, and feedback on the implementation and use of such techniques and results, from the practical side. 

LSFA started in 2006 in Natal (LSFA06) and its second and third editions were held in Ouro Preto ([LSFA07](https://www.mat.unb.br/lsfa2007/)) and Salvador (LSFA08) always as a satellite event to the Brazilian Symposium on Formal Methods (SBMF). In 2009 ([LSFA09](http://lsfa09.cic.unb.br/index.html)) it was held as a satellite event of [RDP](http://rdp09.cic.unb.br/) in Brasília, and subsequently, LSFA was a satellite event of ICTAC in Natal ([LSFA10](http://www.tecmf.inf.puc-rio.br/LSFA)). Since its sixth edition it was held alone in Belo Horizonte (LSFA11), Rio de Janeiro and Niteroi (LSFA12), São Paulo (LSFA13), Brasília ([LSFA14](http://lsfa2014.cic.unb.br/)) and then in Natal ([LSFA15](https://www.mat.ufrn.br/~LSFA2015/LSFA2015/Welcome.html)) as part of NAT@Logic 2015. The eleventh edition, ([LSFA16](http://lsfa2016.mat.unb.br/)), was held as satellite event of [FSCD 2016](http://fscd2016.dcc.fc.up.pt/) in Porto, the twelth edition, ([LSFA17](http://lsfa2017.cic.unb.br/)), in Brasília, as satellite of the collocated conferences [Tableaux](http://www.tableaux-ar.org/)+[FroCoS](http://frocos.cs.uiowa.edu/)+[ITP](https://itp2016.inria.fr/history/), the thirteen edition, ([LSFA18](http://lia.ufc.br/~lsfa2018/)), was held alone in Fortaleza, the fourteen edition, ([LSFA19](https://sites.google.com/view/lsfa2019)), as satellite of [CADE 2019](https://www.mat.ufrn.br/cade-27/) in Natal, and the fifteen edition, ([LSFA20](http://lsfa2020.ufba.br/)), took place in Bahia with the First Brazilian Workshop on Logic [WBL](http://lsfa2020.ufba.br/wbl.html). 

**The Sixteen Logical and Semantic Framework with applications, LSFA 2021, will be proposed as satellite of [FSCD 2021](https://fscd2021.dc.uba.ar/) in Buenos Aires.**
